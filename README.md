# Exploring-eBay-Car-Sales-Data

Worked with a sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka.

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings
